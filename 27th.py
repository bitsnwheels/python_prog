#in this file we are going to study about set methods

cities={"bombay","berlin","Tokyo","ohio"}
cities2={"berlin","madrid","bombay","london"}
     
     #union of two sets
# cities3=cities2.union(cities) #takes the union and returns a new set
# print(cities3)
# cities.update(cities2)       #takes the union,stores in the cities i.e. doesnt make a new set
# print(cities)

     #intersection of two sets
# cities3=cities2.intersection(cities)  #takes the intersection and returns a new set
# print(cities3)
# cities.intersection_update(cities2)    #takes the intersection,stores in the cities i.e.doesnt make a new set
# print(cities)

      #symmetric differnce of two sets
# cities3=cities.symmetric_difference(cities2)   #prints the elements which are not common in the two sets
# print(cities3)         #similarly we can have symmetric_difference_update


# similary we have plethora of set methods and remember internet is always there
