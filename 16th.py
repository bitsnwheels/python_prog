# in order to write function prototype in python we follow the below method  

def mean(a,n):
    pass       #pass keyword tells that this function will be defined later 
 

def compare(a,b):
    if(a>b):
           print(a,"is greater than ",b)
    else:
        print(b,"is greater than ",a)
        
a=float(input("Enter the first number"))
b=float(input("Enter the second number"))
compare(a,b)
