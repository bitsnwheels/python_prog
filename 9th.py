# Note- Strings are immutable i.e. any modification done doesnt change the original string but does all the operations on a separate copy of the string
# a="Adarsh"
# print(len(a))
# print(a)
# print(a.upper())
# print(a.lower())

a = "         adarsh is my name !!!"
print(a)

print(a.strip())  # removes any white spaces before and after the string

print(a.rstrip("!"))  # removes the given trailing characters if present

# we have plethora of string methods and we dont need to remember it .we can
# always have a reference from various webistes
